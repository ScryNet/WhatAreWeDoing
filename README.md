# WhatAreWeDoing
planning

take this 'idea' process' from Altucher's blog and makes it into a site. People can post their ideas and other's comment on them, vet and vote.. so good ideas rise to the top and those that are not quite 'fully baked' get feedback and comments... http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/

each person who has a login can also do profile stuff similar to what they have at catch-a-fire.. list what they are good at (coding, writing business plans etc): https://www.catchafire.org/ so there's people who actually can comment on things and add feedback...
long term it would be cool if it integrated with kickstarter or indie-gogo but by 'helping' voting or commenting you get some of the perks in lieu of putting up moolah...

this would ulitmately create an idea database for people who want to help out other people's ideas..
